I have made some changes in the original code to and have only tested the pre-trained models provided by the original github repository.

This repository has basically trained a model on [ShapeNet](https://shapenet.org/) dataset and thus, we can create 3d models of objects in the ShapeNet dataset using single 2D images of that object.

This repository contains the code for the paper
[Differentiable Volumetric Rendering: Learning Implicit 3D Representations without 3D Supervision](http://www.cvlibs.net/publications/Niemeyer2020CVPR.pdf).

You can find detailed usage instructions for training your own models and using pre-trained models in the docx [file](https://github.com/chakshu-dhannawat/3D_Reconstruction_ImageNet/blob/main/Steps%20to%20run.docx)
